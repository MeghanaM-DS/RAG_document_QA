**Tenali Rama and The Foolish thieves**

> A gang of thieves was ransacking every house in the Vijayanagara
> kingdom. The city chief was troubled as his guards were unable to
> catch the thieves. He sought Tenali Rama's help to put the gang of
> thieves behind bars. Tenali Rama, known for his sharp intellect and
> wit, was a well-known figure in the Vijayanagara kingdom. His ability
> to solve complex problems with clever strategies made him a trusted
> advisor to the king and was favored by the people. Thus, Rama agreed
> to help.
>
> The next day, Rama told his wife to spread a rumor that they have a
> bag of gold coins at home. The news spread like wildfire. The thieves
> too got to hear of it, and they decided to rob Rama's house.
>
> One night, when Tenali Rama and his wife were retiring to sleep, he
> heard leaves rustling in their backyard. Since there was no breeze,
> astute Rama understood that the thieves had come to rob their house.
>
> So, he raised his voice and told his wife, "My dear, I heard that
> there is a gang of thieves on the loose. Let's put all our wealth in a
> big box and drop it in the well. It will be safe underwater."
>
> Rama and his wife pretended to do so and sleep. The thieves and
> swindlers went to the well and began talking to each other.
>
> One of the robbers asked, "The box seems to be big and quite heavy.
> How do we get it out?" Their leader said, "Let's drain all the water
> from the well, then we can easily get down and lift the box."
>
> Everyone agreed to this and started to drain the water from the well.
> It took them the whole night, and they were utterly exhausted. When
> they finally got hold of the box, they were stunned to see only stones
> and rocks in it.
>
> Before they could come out of the shock, they heard Rama's voice. All
> of them turned around and found him saying, "Thank you, companions,
> for watering my plants, I should pay you for your hard work." 
>
> As they turned to run away, the city chief's guards came in and
> captured the gang of crooks. The story of how the smart Tenali Rama
> caught the thieves was the talk of the town for days.
>
> **Moral:** We can overcome any trouble if we do not lose our cool and
> put our brains to work.
