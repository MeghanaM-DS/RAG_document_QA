Course: INFO 555 - Applied NLP - University of Arizona

In this projects I am building a RAG Q&A system by taking PDF files as my data source.

The pipeline contains  
a. Extracting and Pre-processing data from the files

b. Diving the text into small chunks and compute embeddings using NLP models

c. Retrieve relavent documents for the given question.

d. Generate answers with help of LLM based on the context.

e. Evaluate and compare the metrics for pure RAG (answer based on retrieval) and answer generated through LLM
